# 8-Week SQL Challenge
## Introduction
- Welcome to the GitHub repository for my journey through the **[8WeekSQLChallenge](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com)**. 
- The primary purpose of the **8 Week SQL Challenge** is to simulate real-world data scenarios, presenting challenges that a data analyst might encounter in a professional setting. 
- It aims to strengthen my practical SQL skills, going beyond basic query writing to encompass complex data manipulation, analysis, and problem-solving using SQL.

**Why This Challenge?**

- I chose the **8 Week SQL Challenge** because I love data analysis and want to get better at SQL.
- SQL is very important for understanding data and making decisions. I'm excited to learn more about it.

## Technologies and Tools Used

I used Jupyter Notebook for running SQL queries and documenting the process. It's great for seeing results instantly and explaining my steps with notes and visuals.
### ![Vscode](https://img.shields.io/badge/VScode-007ACC?logo=visualstudiocode&)

VSCode was my go-to for writing and editing SQL scripts. Its features, like easy editing and Git integration, helped me manage my code effectively.
### ![mysql](https://img.shields.io/badge/MySQL-ffffff?logo=Mysql)

I utilized MySQL as the primary database for storing and managing data during the challenge. It served as the platform where I created databases, defined tables, and stored the data required for various SQL tasks.
